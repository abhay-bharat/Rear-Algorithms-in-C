                          Stepanov's Binary Counter

Data Structures used : Array of structure of type level_headers is used, size of this array is equal to logn to base 2,
                       where n is the length of the array given as input.
                       The structure level_headers holds a pointer to node of type structure of type node_t(this structure has
                       an array whose length is equal to the level at which it is).
                       It also holds a count(i.e. to know whether that level array has elements), if elements present, then a
                       comparison match is played.
                       There is a temporary array created(temp_arr) of size (level+1).This array at any moment will hold the
                       most current status of the largest element and other elements which lost to this.

Header file used : Header file limits.h is used to store the INT_MIN,(minimum integer element).Since for length which is not a
                   power of 2, the number of elements that will be present in most current status in temp_arr will depend on the
                   values of the array, so the remaining elements are filled with INT_MIN value and will make printing simple.

Key takeaway from this assignment : It was good to know about an algorithm with (n+logn -2) comparisons, which does less number of
                                    comparisons compared to the traditional linear method with (n + n - 2) comparisons.
                                    Got to know about a new way of storing the data(with highest element first and then other elements
                                    lost to it) efficiently using Binary counter.
